SpringLobbyInterface.pm:
=======================
0.5: first public version (beta)

0.7: use mod specific sides instead of hard-coded ARM/CORE in startscript
0.7a: do not cancel start script generation when a player has an invalid side, instead write the nearest side available in current mod

0.7c: log a warning when a command cannot be sent to lobby server

      global pre-callbacks can be added to handle all commands in same function
0.15: added support for REMOVESCRIPTTAGS command
      added support for non-standard 'Skill' field in startscript (generated from "game/players/<lowerCasePlayerName>/skill" start script tag)

0.18: timestamps for latest commands sent and received are now stored in the module
0.19: renamed from PerlLobbyInterface to SpringLobbyInterface
      socket is now used in blocking mode (should fix a rare bug when a lot of data is sent by the bot at the same time), reads are still not blocking thanks to select+sysread
      use LineFeed character specificaly to split commands instead of depending on current system NewLine convention
0.20: extend the startscript additional data functionality to modoptions, mapoptions, and player sections
      prevent empty tag names in startscript
